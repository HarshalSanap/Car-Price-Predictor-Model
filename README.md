## Big Data Class Final Project Fall 2017
### Executive Summary
eBay Motors is an online giant distributor of used cars and currently wants to improve the traffic on their webpage to increase the retention rate of buyers and seller of used cars, due to the loss of almost 30 per cent market in the last 5 years within the used car classified website market. Thus, without new innovative solutions on their webpage eBay risk to lose their position as market leader to their biggest competitor craigslist. In order to address this situation, eBay Motors has approached Revenue Analytics, a data analytics consulting firm. Together they plan to solve the problems under the project named ‘The Next Step’.</br></br>
The main goals of this project are the development of a price predictive feature as the unique addon to the eBay website, and thereby maintain at least 75% accuracy for the price prediction model. Furthermore, focusing the development of a formula that helps in understanding which are the most sold cars for the previous fiscal year. In addition, selecting the most influencing factors and characteristics that makes a used car more saleable in order to increase the seller rate, respectively.</br></br>
Revenue Analytics plans to accomplish the above goals by (1) launch a price predictor feature on the website: Attract new and retain existing customers by enticing them to the unique price predictor model built in R using the approach of Regression. (2) Understand what makes the car more saleable: Identify all the model specifications acting as predictors that increase the probability of car being sold by performing Classification with class labels “sold” and “not sold”. (3) Understand what customers want: Identify the car brands that are popular among customer by performing Text Analysis on car brands.</br></br>
The data collected from the eBay website was highly structured consisting of information about 370k+ cars along with 19 variables. ‘Price’ was used as a dependent variable during regression while class label ‘sold’ or ‘not sold’ was used as a dependent variable for classification. Some of the important categorical predictors had missing values which were replaced with a new category ‘others’ before starting with the model building. The summary of achievements can be stated as below:<br><br>
<b>Regression Analysis:</b> Price predictor functionality worked promisingly with models giving at least 75% correlation. Revenue Analytics recommends an implementation of the price prediction feature on the website.<img src="https://github.com/HarshalSanap/Car-Price-Predictor-Model/blob/master/regression-plot.png"></br></br>
<b>Text Analysis: </b>The most used cars were found using text analysis which stated ‘Volkswagen’, ‘BMW’, and ‘Opel’ to be the top 3 most used cars.

<b>Classification:</b> Revenue analytics is currently not satisfied with the classification accuracy of averaging 51% to predict if a car will be sold or not given its specification and it is still working on improving its models. <img src="https://github.com/HarshalSanap/Car-Price-Predictor-Model/blob/master/Classification%20output.png"></br>
